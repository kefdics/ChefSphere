Chef's Sphere — Enhanced Front-End Demo

How to use:
1. Download and unzip chefs_sphere_enhanced.zip
2. Open the folder in Visual Studio Code.
3. Install the Live Server extension (by Ritwick Dey).
4. Right-click index.html and choose "Open with Live Server" — or open index.html directly in a browser.
5. This demo simulates payments and stores data in your browser's localStorage (no real payments or servers).
6. Files:
   - index.html, about.html, chefs.html, bookings.html, forum.html, schools.html
   - styles.css
   - script.js
7. If you want a real backend, integrate the forms to your server endpoints and replace simulated payment logic with Stripe/PayPal.

Enjoy!
